- Commit your changes.  You will need to use "git add" on your files
   hello.py and README.md, but *not* on credentials.py, because that
   file does not belong on github.  (In later projects it will contain
   confidential information, like access keys and passwords for web
   services.)  Your changes must be "pushed" to your public repository
   on github so that the auto-checker can "clone" them back to the
   grading machine.

- Test your code with the auto-checker.  Revise and push changes
   as needed.

- Turn in with Canvas.  The file you turn in is credentials.ini.  We
   use the repository link in your credentials.ini to access the rest,
   just like the auto-checker.
